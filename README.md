# RuneScape Artifact Calculator (Work in Progress)

The calculator takes an input of an artifact name and how many of that artifact then it returns the amount of each material, total cost of each material, total cost of materials in gp, total experience with and without full archaeology outfit, and experience of each artifact.

The code right now is very messy and unorganized (first iteration) but it works, so please bare with that as I slowly try to make it neater and better.

This project is to help me learn Python and what a fun way to do so is to make this calculator.

For non-RuneScape players, RuneScape is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) created by Jagex. RuneScape has a skill called Archaeology where players excavate various hotspots to obtain damaged artifacts and materials to gain experient points. Players restore the damaged artifacts with the materials either gathered or bought from a trading post called the Grand Exchange (GE) to gain more experience points. This calculator prompts the user to enter an artifact and how many then displays the total cost of materials if the player chooses to buy the materials from the GE, total experience points gained from restoring the artifacts, and material information such as the name, amount, and price of each material.
