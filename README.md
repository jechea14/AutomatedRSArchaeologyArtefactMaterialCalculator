# RuneScapeArtifactCalculator (Work in Progress)

The calculator takes an input of an artifact name and how many of that artifact then returns the total cost of materials in gp.

The code right now is very messy and unorganized (first iteration) but it works, so please bare with that as I slowly try to make it neater and better.

This project is to help me learn Python and what a fun way to do so is to make this calculator.
